# Machine Learning Practice Notebooks

Welcome to my machine learning practice repository! This collection of Python notebooks captures my journey as I explore various machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Overview

This repository serves as a learning playground for machine learning enthusiasts. Inside, you'll find notebooks covering topics such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Unsupervised learning techniques
- Evaluation metrics
- Model deployment
- Deep Learning

Feel free to explore the notebooks and use them as a resource for your own machine learning journey.

## Usage

## List of projects

1. Telecom churn prediction
2. Adult database EDA
3. Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG)
4. Time series forecasting using airline data
5. Fashion image classification 
6. Movie recommendation system

> Some projects will be listed under unnamed because they consist of a single Jupyter notebook.

**Credits.**

I will have to credit the mlcourse website for providing such a good course and materials for practice.
